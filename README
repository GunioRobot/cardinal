Cardinal is a Ruby compiler for Parrot.

The parser is fairly complete.  The standard library exists, but still needs filling out.

Cardinal's parser is very *very* slow.  It should be possible to precompile a script so that you don't need to wait for it to parse each time, but that's currently broken.

Cardinal is not currently in development, but if you have any questions or comments, contact tene@allalone.org
