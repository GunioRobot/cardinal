Cardinal is a Ruby compiler for Parrot.

The parser is fairly complete.  The standard library exists, but still needs filling out.

Cardinal's parser is very *very* slow.  It should be possible to precompile a script so that you don't need to wait for it to parse each time, but that's currently broken.

Cardinal is back in active development, under the stewardship of Ted Reed <ted.reed@gmail.com>.
